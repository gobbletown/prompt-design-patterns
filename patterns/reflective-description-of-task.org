* _Preceeding explanation_ pattern

State what the prompt does at the start At the
start of the example we state in plain
language what the classifier does:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  _This is a tweet sentiment classifier._
#+END_SRC

By stating this up front

it helps the API understand much more quickly
what the goal of the response is supposed to
be

and youâ€™ll end needing to provide fewer
examples.
